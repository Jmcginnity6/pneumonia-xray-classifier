# Pneumonia X-Ray Classifier

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on chest X-ray images to classify pneumonia. It was developed as part of my **first experience with cloud computing**, using **Microsoft Azure** and its **Machine Learning Studio** environment.

The model was trained on the publicly available NIH chest X-ray dataset and performs binary classification (Pneumonia vs. Normal) based on radiograph images.
